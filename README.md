## Project Objectives
Data Visualization: Show the data split of car years, models, and location. <br />
Example: Chart showing the percentage of electric cars in the state of Washington which are made by Tesla, vs toyota, vs nissan, etc. <br />

Any question that can be thought of in regards to the csv dataset should be answered, or at least less ambigious, through our projects outcomes. Large csv’s can be unorganized and impossible to filter through manually. Some examples of questions which could be answered and easily visualized through our project are: 
1. What is the average age of electric cars in area ‘x’? <br />
2. Who is the leading electric car manufacturer in regards to ‘y’ county? <br />
3. Which county in the state of Washington has the highest-cost electric vehicles? <br />
